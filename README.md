### Song Management:
Within each song's page, an artist has the following options:

3. **Update Song Lyrics**: Modify the lyrics of the song.

### Add a New Song:
When adding a new song, the artist must ensure they have at least one album. The artist can then select an existing album for the song and provide the song's title and lyrics.

### Album Management:
Artists can view all their albums. Upon selecting an album, they have the following options:
1. **View Songs in Album**: See all songs within the selected album.
2. **Edit Album**: Modify details of the album, with options to:
